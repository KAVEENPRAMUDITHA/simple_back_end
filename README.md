simple-backend - CI/CD and Quality Assurance Documentation
This document provides an overview of the CI/CD and quality assurance setup for the simple-backend project.

Phase 2: Development Environment & Workflow (25%)
Git Workflow Implementation
Branch protection rules and code review requirements:
Branch protection rules have been configured in the GitHub repository settings to require pull request reviews and status checks to pass before merging.
To configure branch protection rules:
Go to the GitHub repository settings.
Click on "Branches".
Click on "Add rule".
Enter the branch name pattern (e.g., main).
Configure the branch protection rules (e.g., require pull request reviews, require status checks to pass before merging).
Click on "Create".
Conventional Commits with automated changelog generation:
The commitlint and conventional-changelog-cli dependencies have been added to the project.
A commitlint.config.js file has been created in the root of the repository to configure commitlint.
A prepare-commit-msg hook has been added to the project to validate commit messages using husky.
A changelog script has been added to package.json to generate the changelog using conventional-changelog-cli.
Automated dependency updates and security patches:
A dependabot.yml file has been created in the .github directory to configure Dependabot to automatically update dependencies and apply security patches on a weekly basis.
Pull request templates and contribution guidelines:
A PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md file has been created in the .github directory to provide a pull request template.
A CONTRIBUTING.md file has been created in the root of the repository to provide contribution guidelines.
Project Management Integration
GitHub Projects with automated workflows:
GitHub Projects can be configured with automated workflows to move issues between columns based on their status.
To configure GitHub Projects:
Go to the GitHub repository.
Click on "Projects".
Create a new project or select an existing one.
Configure the project columns (e.g., "To do", "In progress", "Done").
Configure automated workflows to move issues between columns based on their status (e.g., when an issue is closed, move it to the "Done" column).
Issue templates for bugs, features, and technical debt:
Issue templates for bugs, features, and technical debt have been created in the .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE directory.
SLA monitoring for issue resolution:
SLA monitoring for issue resolution can be established using external tools such as GitHub Insights, ZenHub, or Jira.
Team collaboration protocols:
A CODEOWNERS file has been created in the root of the repository to define code ownership.
Phase 3: CI/CD & Quality Assurance (30%)
Automated Pipeline Configuration
Matrix testing across multiple Node.js versions:
The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to include matrix testing across Node.js versions 18 and 20.
Parallel test execution for unit, integration, and E2E tests:
Parallel test execution can be configured using the --maxWorkers option in Jest, the --parallel option in Mocha, or the --concurrency option in TestCafe.
Dependency caching and artifact management:
The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to include dependency caching using the actions/cache action.
Security scanning (SAST, DAST, SCA) with defined quality gates:
The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to include security scanning using Snyk.
The SNYK_TOKEN environment variable needs to be configured in the GitHub repository settings.
Monitoring & Observability
Distributed tracing and logging infrastructure can be configured using external tools such as Jaeger, Zipkin, the ELK Stack, or Splunk.
Custom metrics and SLO monitoring can be implemented using external tools such as Prometheus and Grafana.
Alerting rules and incident response procedures can be created using external tools such as PagerDuty or Opsgenie.
Synthetic monitoring for critical user journeys can be set up using external tools such as New Relic Synthetics or Pingdom.
Phase 4: Production Deployment & Documentation (25%)
Infrastructure & Deployment
Multi-environment deployment pipeline (dev, staging, prod) can be configured using cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
A blue-green deployment strategy can be implemented using cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
CDN and edge caching configuration can be set up using cloud providers such as AWS CloudFront, Azure CDN, or Google Cloud CDN.
Disaster recovery and backup procedures can be created using cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
